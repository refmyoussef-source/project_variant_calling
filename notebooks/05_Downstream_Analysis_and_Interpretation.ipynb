    "The comparative analysis has successfully identified 48 *de novo* mutations (variants present in treated samples but absent from the Control). These \"prime suspects\" tell a clear biological story of adaptation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Daptomycin (DAP) Resistance Pathway (Membrane Adaptation):**\n",
    "The DAP-treated samples (`DAP_P20`, `DAP_Final`) show a cluster of significant `missense` mutations in genes critical for cell membrane homeostasis:\n",
    "* **`mprF`**: A well-known DAP resistance gene that alters membrane charge.\n",
    "* **`agrA`**: The master regulator of virulence, linked to membrane properties.\n",
    "* **`pgsA`** & **`cls`**: Key enzymes in membrane lipid biosynthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Vancomycin (VAN) Resistance Pathway (Cell Wall Stress Response):**\n",
    "The VAN-treated samples show `missense` mutations in two-component sensor systems:\n",
    "* **`vraG`** & **`vraT`**: Components of the `Vra` system that senses cell wall damage.\n",
    "* **`srrA`**: Another stress-response regulator.\n",
    "This suggests the VAN samples adapted by permanently activating their cell wall defense pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The \"Hypermutator\" Engine (`mutL`):**\n",
    "Perhaps the most significant finding is the emergence of **high-impact `frameshift` mutations** in the DNA mismatch-repair gene **`mutL`** in the DAP lineage. This \"knock-out\" mutation likely created a \"hypermutator\" state, accelerating the rate of mutation and allowing genes like `mprF` to acquire resistance-conferring mutations rapidly.\n",
